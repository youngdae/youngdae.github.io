I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering, and I am also jointly affiliated with the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST).
My research interestes are in numerical optimization that leverages AI and high-performance computing with GPUs, with applications in power systems, genome-wide association studies, and manufacturing process optimization.
Prior to joining UNIST in 2024, I was a Postdoctoral Appointee in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory (2018-2022) and a Research Associate at ExxonMobil, New Jersey (2022-2024).

See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sha3L-0AAAAJ&hl=en) for publications.

I am always looking for highly motivated students who are interested in working at the intersection of optimization, AI, and GPU computing. One position is currently available.
